# Your First Game

In this tutorial, you'll create your first chess variant - **King of the Hill**. This variant adds a new win condition: move your King to the center of the board to win instantly.

## Prerequisites

- Open the [Playground](/playground)
- Familiarize yourself with the editor interface

## Step 1: Define Your Game

Start with the basic game definition:

```chesslang
game: "King of the Hill"
extends: "Standard Chess"
```

This creates a new game called "King of the Hill" that inherits all rules from standard chess.

## Step 2: Define the Hill Zone

Next, define which squares constitute "the hill":

```chesslang
game: "King of the Hill"
extends: "Standard Chess"

board:
  zones:
    hill: [d4, d5, e4, e5]
```

The `zones` section defines named areas on the board. Here, we define `hill` as the four center squares.

## Step 3: Add the Victory Condition

Now add the new win condition:

```chesslang
game: "King of the Hill"
extends: "Standard Chess"

board:
  zones:
    hill: [d4, d5, e4, e5]

victory:
  add:
    hill: King in zone.hill
```

The `victory.add` section adds a new victory condition. The condition `King in zone.hill` triggers when your King reaches any square in the hill zone.

## Step 4: Run Your Game

1. Click the **Run** button in the playground
2. The chess board will reset with your custom rules
3. Try to move your King to the center while protecting it!

## Complete Code

Here's the complete code for King of the Hill:

```chesslang
game: "King of the Hill"
extends: "Standard Chess"

board:
  zones:
    hill: [d4, d5, e4, e5]

victory:
  add:
    hill: King in zone.hill
```

## What You Learned

- How to create a new game with `game:` and `extends:`
- How to define board zones
- How to add custom victory conditions

## Next Steps

- Try modifying the hill zone to include more squares
- Add visual highlighting to the hill squares (see [Effects](/docs/language/level2#effects))
- Learn about [Level 2](/docs/language/level2) to create custom pieces

## Challenge: Three-Check

Try creating "Three-Check" on your own:

```chesslang
game: "Three-Check"
extends: "Standard Chess"

victory:
  add:
    three_checks: checks >= 3
```

This variant adds a win condition for giving check three times.
