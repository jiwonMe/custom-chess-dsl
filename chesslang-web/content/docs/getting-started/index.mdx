# Getting Started with ChessLang

ChessLang is a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining chess variants. Whether you want to create simple rule modifications or entirely new games, ChessLang makes it easy.

## What is ChessLang?

ChessLang provides three levels of complexity:

1. **Level 1 (Configure)** - YAML-like configuration for simple modifications
2. **Level 2 (Compose)** - Declarative DSL for custom pieces and triggers
3. **Level 3 (Script)** - JavaScript-like scripting for complex logic

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example that creates "King of the Hill" - a variant where you win by moving your King to the center:

```chesslang
game: "King of the Hill"
extends: "Standard Chess"

board:
  zones:
    hill: [d4, d5, e4, e5]

victory:
  add:
    hill: King in zone.hill
```

## Try It Now

The best way to learn ChessLang is to try it yourself:

1. Open the [Playground](/playground)
2. Modify the example code
3. Click "Run" to see your changes
4. Play your custom variant!
