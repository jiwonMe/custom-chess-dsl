# Movement Patterns

Movement patterns define how pieces can move on the board.

## Basic Patterns

### step

Moves a fixed number of squares in a direction.

```chesslang
step(direction)           # 1 square
step(direction, N)        # N squares
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| direction | Direction | Movement direction |
| distance | number | Number of squares (default: 1) |

**Examples:**

```chesslang
# King movement
move: step(any)

# Pawn initial double move
move: step(forward, 2) where first_move and clear
```

### slide

Moves any number of squares in a direction until blocked.

```chesslang
slide(direction)
```

**Examples:**

```chesslang
# Rook movement
move: slide(orthogonal)

# Bishop movement
move: slide(diagonal)

# Queen movement
move: slide(orthogonal) | slide(diagonal)
```

### leap

Jumps to a specific offset, ignoring pieces in between.

```chesslang
leap(dx, dy)
```

**Note:** All 8 rotations/reflections are automatically included.

**Examples:**

```chesslang
# Knight movement
move: leap(2, 1)

# Camel (fairy piece)
move: leap(3, 1)

# Zebra (fairy piece)
move: leap(3, 2)
```

### hop

Jumps over a piece and lands on the other side.

```chesslang
hop(direction)
```

**Examples:**

```chesslang
# Cannon-like movement (can capture by hopping)
capture: hop(orthogonal)
```

## Pattern Combinators

### Or (`|`)

Choose between multiple patterns.

```chesslang
pattern1 | pattern2
```

**Example:**

```chesslang
# Queen = Rook + Bishop
move: slide(orthogonal) | slide(diagonal)
```

### Then (`+`)

Sequential movement (for special pieces).

```chesslang
pattern1 + pattern2
```

**Example:**

```chesslang
# Gryphon: moves diagonally then orthogonally
move: step(diagonal) + slide(orthogonal)
```

### Repeat (`*`)

Repeat a pattern N times.

```chesslang
pattern * N
```

**Example:**

```chesslang
# Move exactly 3 squares
move: step(forward) * 3 where clear
```

### Conditional (`where`)

Add conditions to patterns.

```chesslang
pattern where condition
```

**Example:**

```chesslang
# Pawn double move only on first move
move: step(forward, 2) where first_move and clear
```

## Directions Reference

| Direction | Vector | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `N` | (0, 1) | North (up) |
| `S` | (0, -1) | South (down) |
| `E` | (1, 0) | East (right) |
| `W` | (-1, 0) | West (left) |
| `NE` | (1, 1) | Northeast |
| `NW` | (-1, 1) | Northwest |
| `SE` | (1, -1) | Southeast |
| `SW` | (-1, -1) | Southwest |
| `orthogonal` | N\|S\|E\|W | Cardinal directions |
| `diagonal` | NE\|NW\|SE\|SW | Diagonal directions |
| `any` | all 8 | All directions |
| `forward` | N for White, S for Black | Player-relative forward |
| `backward` | S for White, N for Black | Player-relative backward |
