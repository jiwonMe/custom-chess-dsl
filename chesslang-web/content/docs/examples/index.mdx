victory:
  add:
    hill: King in zone.hill
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Defining board zones
- Adding victory conditions
- Zone references in conditions

  game.state.movesRequired = 1;
  game.state.movesThisTurn = 0;

  game.on("move", function(event) {
    game.state.movesThisTurn++;

    // Check for check - turn ends immediately
    if (game.isCheck(opponent(game.currentPlayer))) {
      game.endTurn();
      return;
    }

    // Check if required moves completed
    if (game.state.movesThisTurn >= game.state.movesRequired) {
      game.endTurn();
    }
  });

  game.on("turnEnd", function(event) {
    // Next player gets one more move
    game.state.movesRequired++;
    game.state.movesThisTurn = 0;
  });

  // Display moves remaining
  game.getStatus = function() {
    const remaining = game.state.movesRequired - game.state.movesThisTurn;
    return `Moves remaining: ${remaining}`;
  };
}
```
