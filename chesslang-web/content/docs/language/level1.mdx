# Level 1: Configure

Level 1 is the simplest way to create chess variants. Using a YAML-like syntax, you can modify standard chess rules without any programming knowledge.

## Overview

Level 1 is perfect for:
- Adding new victory or draw conditions
- Modifying board setup
- Defining zones on the board
- Adjusting existing rules

## Basic Structure

Every ChessLang file starts with a game definition:

```chesslang
game: "My Chess Variant"
extends: "Standard Chess"
```

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `game` | Yes | Name of your variant |
| `extends` | No | Base game to inherit from (default: "Standard Chess") |

## Board Configuration

### Board Size

```chesslang
board:
  size: 8x8
```

You can create larger or smaller boards:

```chesslang
board:
  size: 10x8    # 10 files, 8 ranks
```

### Zones

Zones define named areas on the board:

```chesslang
board:
  zones:
    hill: [d4, d5, e4, e5]
    promotion_zone: [a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, h8]
    danger_zone: [d4-e5]    # Range notation
```

Zones can be referenced in conditions using `zone.zoneName`.

## Piece Setup

### Standard Setup

By default, extending "Standard Chess" gives you the standard piece setup. You can override it:

```chesslang
setup:
  White:
    King: [e1]
    Queen: [d1]
    Rook: [a1, h1]
    Bishop: [c1, f1]
    Knight: [b1, g1]
    Pawn: [a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2]
  Black:
    King: [e8]
    Queen: [d8]
    Rook: [a8, h8]
    Bishop: [c8, f8]
    Knight: [b8, g8]
    Pawn: [a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7]
```

### Modified Setup

Create variants with different starting positions:

```chesslang
# Chess960-style setup
setup:
  White:
    King: [d1]
    Queen: [e1]
    Rook: [a1, h1]
    Bishop: [b1, g1]
    Knight: [c1, f1]
    Pawn: [a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2]
```

### Adding Extra Pieces

```chesslang
setup:
  add:
    White:
      Amazon: [d3]    # Custom piece (must be defined)
    Black:
      Amazon: [d6]
```

## Victory Conditions

### Adding Victory Conditions

Add new ways to win while keeping checkmate:

```chesslang
victory:
  add:
    hill: King in zone.hill
    racing: King on rank 8
```

### Replacing Victory Conditions

Replace the default checkmate condition:

```chesslang
victory:
  replace:
    capture_king: King captured
```

### Removing Victory Conditions

```chesslang
victory:
  remove:
    - checkmate
```

### Victory Condition Syntax

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `King in zone.X` | King reaches zone X |
| `King on rank N` | King reaches rank N |
| `King on file X` | King reaches file X |
| `King captured` | King is captured |
| `checks >= N` | Give N or more checks |
| `pieces <= N` | Opponent has N or fewer pieces |

## Draw Conditions

### Adding Draw Conditions

```chesslang
draw:
  add:
    bare_king: pieces == 1 and opponent.pieces == 1
```

### Modifying Repetition Rules

```chesslang
draw:
  modify:
    repetition: 5    # 5-fold instead of 3-fold
    fifty_moves: 100 # 100 moves instead of 50
```

### Built-in Draw Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `stalemate` | No legal moves, not in check |
| `repetition` | Position repeated 3 times |
| `fifty_moves` | 50 moves without capture or pawn move |
| `insufficient` | Insufficient material |

## Rules Configuration

### Castling

```chesslang
rules:
  castling: true     # Enable (default)
  castling: false    # Disable
```

### En Passant

```chesslang
rules:
  en_passant: true   # Enable (default)
  en_passant: false  # Disable
```

### Promotion

```chesslang
rules:
  promotion:
    pieces: [Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight]  # Available promotions
    rank: 8                                 # Promotion rank
```

### Check Rules

```chesslang
rules:
  check:
    must_escape: true    # Must get out of check (default)
    can_ignore: false    # Can ignore check
```
